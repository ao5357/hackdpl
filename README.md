# \#hackDPL

The driving force behind \#hackDPL is to create a mobile app for the Detroit Public Library that fulfill's patrons' information needs.

## Our Vision

  1. Openness
    * Open Source - Drupal, freely licensed fonts
    * Open Web - more open than device platforms
  2. Configuration
    * Defaults - reasonable base settings for content and fields
    * Extensible - make it easy to add new things to pages
  3. Style
    * Responsive - sites looks and works similarly on any device
    * Visual language - extend the brand in reasonable ways
  4. Interoperability
    * URLS - if someone shares a link, it's the same everywhere
    * Apps - using phonegap or similar

We hope to deliver a Drupal 7-based responsive starter site that any developer can add content to and extend to make it the next version of the DPL site.
