# \#hackDPL

The driving force behind \#hackDPL is to create a mobile app for the Detroit Public Library that fulfill's patrons' information needs.

## Our Vision

  1. Openness
    * Open Source - Drupal, freely licensed fonts
    * Open Web - more open than device platforms
  2. Configuration
    * Defaults - reasonable base settings for content and fields
    * Extensible - make it easy to add new things to pages
  3. Style
    * Responsive - sites looks and works similarly on any device
    * Visual language - extend the brand in reasonable ways
  4. Interoperability
    * URLS - if someone shares a link, it's the same everywhere
    * Apps - using phonegap or similar

We hope to deliver a Drupal 7-based responsive starter site that any developer can add content to and extend to make it the next version of the DPL site.

## Why do this?

Conceptually, making apps is exclusive; you'd have to make a separate app for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, etc.

The open web is available from the widest range of devices at the lowest barrier to entry.

Additionally, it fits best with the described scenario (a patron wishing to find out open hours before traveling to his/her local branch), based on the following assumptions:

  * The patrons most likely to install the app are also those most likely to already know closure information
  * Information-seekers on mobile devices are more likely to search the web than search the app store

With these principles in mind, building a responsive site is the most productive choice.
